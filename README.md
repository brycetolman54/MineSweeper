# MineSweeper

A repository to hold the version of minesweeper that I am building in order to test my hand at machine learning

- [ ] Figure out how to do the window to play
- [ ] Don't make reveal reveal all squares, allow the ML to figure out to open all the blank squares
- [ ] Figure out how to let the program choose any outcome (reveal or show or flag any square)
- [ ] make the feedback tell you if you hit a bomb (bad), flagged a square that was a bomb (good), flagged a square that wasn't a bomb (bad) or reveal some amount of squares (the more the better)
    - That is the reward that tells us what to do
- [ ] Code a pereptron
- [ ] Look at the ML thing you have and figure out how it works to let the program select from various outputs
